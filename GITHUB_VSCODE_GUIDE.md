git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

**Important:** Use the same email as your GitHub account!

---

## Part 2: Open Your Project in VS Code

### Method 1: Drag and Drop
1. Unzip `shopping_list_app.zip`
2. Drag the `shopping_list_app` folder onto VS Code window
3. VS Code opens the folder ✅

### Method 2: File Menu
1. Open VS Code
2. Click **File** → **Open Folder...**
3. Navigate to your `shopping_list_app` folder
4. Click **"Select Folder"** (Windows) or **"Open"** (Mac)

### Verify You're in the Right Place

Look at the left sidebar (Explorer panel):
```
SHOPPING_LIST_APP
├── app.py
├── templates
│   └── index.html
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
└── ... (other files)
```

✅ **You're ready!**

---

## Part 3: Sign in to GitHub in VS Code

### Step 1: Open Source Control

Click the **Source Control** icon in the left sidebar (looks like a branch: ⑂)

OR press: `Ctrl+Shift+G` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+G` (Mac)

### Step 2: Sign in to GitHub

You'll see a message like "No source control providers registered"

1. Click **"Initialize Repository"** button
2. VS Code may prompt: **"Sign in to use GitHub"**
3. Click **"Allow"**
4. Your browser opens
5. Click **"Authorize GitHub"**
6. You may need to enter your GitHub password
7. You'll see "Success!" message
8. Close the browser tab
9. Return to VS Code

✅ **VS Code is now connected to GitHub!**

---

## Part 4: Initialize Git Repository

### Option A: Using VS Code UI

1. Go to **Source Control** panel (left sidebar)
2. Click **"Initialize Repository"** button
3. You'll see all your files appear in the Source Control panel

### Option B: Using Terminal

1. Open Terminal in VS Code (`` Ctrl+` ``)
2. Type:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```
3. Press Enter

You should see:
```
Initialized empty Git repository in .../shopping_list_app/.git/
```

✅ **Git repository initialized!**

---

## Part 5: Verify .gitignore (CRITICAL!)

This prevents you from uploading sensitive files!

### Check if .gitignore exists:

1. Look in the Explorer panel (left sidebar)
2. Look for `.gitignore` file
3. If you see it → Click to open it

### .gitignore should contain:

```gitignore
# Environment variables
.env

# Google Sheets credentials  
credentials.json

# Python
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class
*.so
.Python
env/
venv/
ENV/
build/
dist/
*.egg-info/

# IDE
.vscode/
.idea/
*.swp

# OS
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
```

### If .gitignore doesn't exist:

1. In VS Code, click **File** → **New File**
2. Name it exactly: `.gitignore`
3. Paste the content above
4. Save the file (`Ctrl+S` or `Cmd+S`)

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** This prevents `credentials.json` and `.env` from being uploaded to GitHub!

---

## Part 6: Stage Your Files (Add to Git)

### Understanding What's Happening

When you look at the **Source Control** panel, you'll see all your files listed with a **U** (Untracked) next to them.

We need to "stage" these files (tell Git we want to track them).

### Method 1: Stage All Files at Once (Recommended)

1. In **Source Control** panel
2. Look for **"Changes"** section
3. Hover over **"Changes"**
4. Click the **"+"** (plus) icon that appears
5. All files move to **"Staged Changes"**

### Method 2: Stage Individual Files

1. In **Source Control** panel
2. Find a file under **"Changes"**
3. Hover over the filename
4. Click the **"+"** icon next to it
5. File moves to **"Staged Changes"**

### What You Should See:

```
STAGED CHANGES (15)
├── app.py
├── templates/index.html
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
├── ... (all your files)
```

### Files You Should NOT See:

❌ `.env` (if you created one)
❌ `credentials.json` (if you created one)
❌ `__pycache__/`

If you see these, they're being ignored by `.gitignore` ✅

---

## Part 7: Commit Your Changes

A "commit" is like taking a snapshot of your code.

### Step 1: Write a Commit Message

1. In **Source Control** panel at the top
2. You'll see a text box that says **"Message"**
3. Type a commit message:
   ```
   Initial commit: Shopping list app with Google Sheets and WhatsApp integration
   ```

### Step 2: Commit

Click the **"✓ Commit"** button (or press `Ctrl+Enter`)

### What Happens:

- All staged files are committed
- The **"Staged Changes"** section clears
- Your changes are now saved in Git history

✅ **First commit completed!**

---

## Part 8: Create GitHub Repository

Now we need a place on GitHub to push our code.

### Method 1: Using VS Code (Easiest!)

1. In **Source Control** panel
2. Click the **"Publish to GitHub"** button
3. VS Code shows a popup: **"Publish to GitHub"**
4. Choose:
   - **"Publish to GitHub private repository"** (Recommended)
   - OR **"Publish to GitHub public repository"**
5. VS Code may ask: **"The extension 'GitHub' wants to sign in using GitHub"**
   - Click **"Allow"**
6. Browser opens → Click **"Authorize Visual-Studio-Code"**
7. Enter your GitHub password if prompted
8. Return to VS Code
9. Wait a few seconds...
10. You'll see: **"Successfully published to GitHub"**

✅ **Done! Your code is on GitHub!**

### Method 2: Create Repository Manually

If the automatic method doesn't work:

1. Open browser and go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click **"+"** icon (top-right) → **"New repository"**
3. Fill in:
   - **Repository name:** `shopping-list-app`
   - **Description:** (optional) `Web app for shopping lists`
   - **Visibility:** Choose Private or Public
   - ❌ **DO NOT** check any checkboxes (no README, no .gitignore, no license)
4. Click **"Create repository"**
5. **Keep this page open!** You'll need the URL

---

## Part 9: Connect to GitHub Repository (Manual Method)

**Only do this if you used Method 2 above!**

### Step 1: Copy Repository URL

On the GitHub page, you'll see:
```
…or push an existing repository from the command line
```

Under it, you'll see commands like:
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/shopping-list-app.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Run Commands in VS Code Terminal

1. Open Terminal in VS Code (`` Ctrl+` ``)
2. Copy the first command and paste it:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/shopping-list-app.git
   ```
   (Replace YOUR-USERNAME with your actual GitHub username)
3. Press Enter
4. Copy the second command:
   ```bash
   git branch -M main
   ```
5. Press Enter
6. Copy the third command:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```
7. Press Enter

### Step 3: Authenticate (If Prompted)

**Windows:**
- A window pops up asking for GitHub credentials
- Sign in with your GitHub username and password
- If you have 2FA, use a Personal Access Token (see below)

**Mac/Linux:**
- Enter your GitHub username
- For password, use a Personal Access Token (see below)

### Creating a Personal Access Token (If Needed)

1. Go to [github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click **"Generate new token"** → **"Generate new token (classic)"**
3. Give it a name: `VS Code Push`
4. Set expiration: `90 days` or `No expiration`
5. Check these scopes:
   - ✅ `repo` (all repo permissions)
6. Scroll down and click **"Generate token"**
7. **COPY THE TOKEN!** (You won't see it again)
8. Use this token as your password when pushing

### Verify Push Succeeded

In the Terminal, you should see:
```
Enumerating objects: 15, done.
Counting objects: 100% (15/15), done.
...
To https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/shopping-list-app.git
 * [new branch]      main -> main
```

✅ **Your code is now on GitHub!**

---

## Part 10: Verify on GitHub

### Check Your Repository

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click on your profile icon → **"Your repositories"**
3. Click on **"shopping-list-app"**

You should see:
- ✅ All your files (app.py, README.md, etc.)
- ✅ Your commit message
- ✅ Folder structure (templates/)
- ❌ NO .env file
- ❌ NO credentials.json file

If you see .env or credentials.json → **REMOVE THEM IMMEDIATELY!** (See "Emergency: Remove Sensitive Files" below)

---

## Part 11: Making Future Changes

### Every time you make changes:

**Step 1: Make your changes**
- Edit files in VS Code
- Save files (`Ctrl+S`)

**Step 2: Stage changes**
- Go to **Source Control** panel
- Click **"+"** next to changed files (or click "+" on "Changes" to stage all)

**Step 3: Commit**
- Write a commit message (e.g., "Add price tracking feature")
- Click **"✓ Commit"**

**Step 4: Push to GitHub**
- Click **"Sync Changes"** button (↻)
- OR click the **"..."** menu → **"Push"**

That's it! Your changes are on GitHub.
