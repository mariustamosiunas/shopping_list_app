## Tips:

1. **Aisle_Order**: Adjust these numbers based on YOUR store's layout
   - Start from the entrance and number aisles in the order you encounter them
   - Same category items should have the same Aisle_Order

2. **Categories**: Use categories that make sense for your shopping habits
   - Keep them consistent
   - You can have as many as you want

3. **Adding Items**: Just add new rows with the same three columns
   - Item name
   - Category
   - Aisle order number

4. **Updating**: Any changes you make in Google Sheets will be reflected immediately in the app
